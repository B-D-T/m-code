# m-code
Functions and other M code for use in Power Query/ Power BI  

These are functions, tables, and other M code that I use in several files. I don't expect others will want any of this, since it's customized to the needs of my projects, but I'm keeping it on GitHub in case it helps others. And because I needed a central repository for my commonly used PQ functions, so it might as well be GitHub.
